# Code for the paper "From the diagnosis of infectious keratitis to discriminating fungal subtypes; a deep learning-based study"
Infectious keratitis (IK) is a major cause of corneal opacity. IK can be caused by a variety of microorganisms. Typically, fungal ulcers carry the worst prognosis. Fungal cases can be subdivided into filamentous and yeasts, which shows fundamental differences. Delays in diagnosis or initiation of treatment increase the risk of ocular complications. Currently, the diagnosis of IK is mainly based on slit-lamp examination and corneal scrapings. Notably, these diagnostic methods have their drawbacks, including experience-dependency, tissue damage, and time consumption. Artificial intelligence (AI) is designed to mimic and enhance human decision-making. An increasing number of studies have utilized AI in the diagnosis of IK. In this paper, we propose to use AI to diagnose IK (model 1), differentiate between bacterial keratitis and fungal keratitis (model 2), and discriminate the filamentous type from the yeast type of fungal cases (model 3). Overall, 9329 slit-lamp photographs gathered from 977 patients were enrolled in the study. The models exhibited remarkable accuracy, with model 1 achieving 99.3%, model 2 at 84%, and model 3 reaching 77.5%. In conclusion, our study offers valuable support in the early identification of potential fungal and bacterial keratitis cases and helps enable timely management.
